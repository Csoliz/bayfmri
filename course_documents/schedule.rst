Set up doodle poll (bob)
Send a broad invitation, but make it clear about the prerequisites:

* Some programming knowledge (matlab or python)
* Familiarity with the shell

Target week of Dec 17th for beta-run. Ariel: Dec. 18, 19 or 20. Bob: Dec. 18

One-day course:

[skip for beta] Getting started: crash course on the shell, ipython, etc.

An attempt at the schedule :
----------------------------

10:00-10:10 : Intro to the course 

10:10 - 13:00 : fMRI preprocessing - Image manipulation and visualization (2 hours)


    * python packaging and installation issue / imports ...
      + image manipulation - artefact detection (Matthew + Michael ? )

    * fMRI preprocessing : (Bob) 
      - realignment - slice timing - physiology signal removal

    * coregistration (Bob) and spatial normalization (Matthew)

    * Simple linear regression - GLM (Ariel)

13:00-14:00: Lunch

14:00-15:30 First level analysis
    
    * testing at one voxel: GLM / t-F tests (JB)

    * HRF modelling -Fitting - AR(1) noise (JB + Matthew)

15:30-16:00 Break

16:00-18:00: Connectivity, Second level Analysis, Vizualization

    * Functional connectivity (Ariel)
